## WHAT is kernel?
● Kernel is a code/program that used to meet your Software and Hardware. And allocate some
resources.
## History of Linux
● In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer,
● which was chosen mainly because of Thompson's familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it
● BUT IT WASN’T CHEAP AND OPEN-SOURCE
● Then Person called “LINUS TORVALDS” Created the Linux kernel. And posted it online to make it
open-source.
● Richard Stallman announced the GNU project in 1983 and cofounded the Free Software
Foundation in 1985.
● GNU is a free software replacement to the UNIX OS, But it was just software replacement not full
os {Examples: Bash,tar,emacs…} .
● So GNU + LINUX will give the GNU/Linux OS.
● The GNU Linux project was started to create a Unix-like operating system created with source
code that could be copied, modified, and redistributed
### What is Shell?
● Users communicate with the kernel by the shell.
● The Shell is a Command Line Interpreter. It translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the Kernel.
### Types of shells
● Based on their features there are money shells.
○ SH
○ BASH
○ ZSH
○ FISH
They differ in Coloring, Piping, command compilation, some kind of features.
- TO IDENTIFY YOUR SHELL “echo $SHELL”
# What is OS- Operating system??
● We have said UNIX and GNU/Linux as OS but what is OS.

● The Linux market size worldwide will reach $15.64 billion by 2027.
● The world’s top 500 fastest supercomputers all run on Linux.
● 96.3% of the top one million web servers are running Linux.
● Today, there are over 600 active Linux distrosLinux?
●
### Why Linux?
1. Most hacking tools
2. Most Secured!

C) Live boot
D) Cloud terminals
#### ● Computers have a Technology called
“VIRTUALIZATION”. This is the
method how it allocate our using
memory to the virtual machines/ VM’s
● This is a method to use windows and
linux together.
● Softwares that gives you This ability:
○ HyberV
○ QEMU
○ Virtual Box - Oracle
○ VMware
