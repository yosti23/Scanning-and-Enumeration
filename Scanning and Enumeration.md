What is Scanning?
● Scanning is the 2nd phase of Ethical Hacking.
● It is the step which helps to test a system based on
the information we gathered.
● Scanning is another essential step, which is
necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques
or procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and
various services within a system
Why do we do scanning?
● It helps to Identify HOST’s System detail
○ Operation System
○ Service versions
● To Discover Open Ports
● To Discover Live Systems

Network Scanning
● This is a method of Scanning a network and getting
more informations.
● There are Many kinds of scanning methods and tools
for different purpose.
○ For Network mainly, NMAP
○ For Subdomain, Sublist3r,subfinder
○ For website vulnerability, Nessus, Acunitix..
Nmap - Network Mapper
● Nmap is A network scanning and exploring tool used by network
and security experts.
● It is used to scan Network,Ports,OS,...
● It is made for windows and linux
● ON kali linux it is built in.
● To check the existence of nmap on your system

Live System Discovery
● Discovering live system means, Checking up and
running hosts(clients/servers) on a network.
● We have seen Host checking last time with ping
sweep method.(getting ip with link)
● But How does the ping worked?
Ping Sweep
● This is a method of checking if host is up or down.
● It uses ICMP(Internet Control Message Protocol) packets for checking
purpose
● It sends Echo request and waits for response if there is Echo reply then that
system is up!Ping Sweep
